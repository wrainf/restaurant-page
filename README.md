# restaurant-page

This website was created almost entirely with JavaScript. By doing this project I learnt about webpack as well as npm and modifying package.json. This project was very exciting for me as I'm finally using technologies besides the HTML/CSS/JS combo. I also touched a bit on gitignore files and css animations as well as modifying webpack.config.js files.
